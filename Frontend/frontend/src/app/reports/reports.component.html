  <p>
    As of 2023, AI has matched or surpassed human-level performance on numerous benchmarks in areas like reading comprehension, image classification, and visual reasoning, though it still falls short in tasks like competition-level math and complex strategic planning. With AI rapidly exceeding many standard tests, researchers have introduced new benchmarks to push its limits in coding, advanced reasoning, and autonomous behavior, marking a significant expansion in AI's capabilities.
