  <div class="summary__content">
    Multimodal AI represents a major leap forward in artificial intelligence, enabling systems to process and combine different types of data—like text, images, and audio—in a way that mimics human perception. This breakthrough allows AI to interact more intuitively and flexibly with the world, from virtual assistants that respond to both spoken commands and visual cues to advanced systems that integrate sensory inputs for complex learning. Multimodal models are transforming AI’s capabilities across fields, opening up innovative applications and bringing us closer to a more versatile, human-like intelligence.</div>
